The union president Roger Goodell (<a href="http://www.wholesalebestjerseys.net/">Wholesale Jerseys</a>) continue to talk about the NFL team moved to London the possibility when the team moved on to League one in Losangeles in the past few years is silence.
 <br /><br />
But Magic Johnson (Magic Johnson) to talk about this matter.
 <br /><br />
"I think this is the first time, I truly believe that we will eventually have a team," Johnson said Tuesday on YAHOO sports. "Everyone is ready. The whole city is ready. The business world is ready. NFL ready. Eventually we will go. In a few years later, after at least 24 months, I think there will be a team <a href="http://www.wholesalegoodjerseys.com">Wholesale Cheap Jerseys Free Shipping</a>. I don't know which team, but I believe that we will have a team after 2 years."
 <br /><br />
2 years? Wow, okay. It seems incredible, because currently there is no Losangeles to build a new stadium. Although there have been discussed renovation of Losangeles Memorial Stadium - lightning, rams and Raiders have played here -- the Southern California sports director pat Hayden said the plan is still 3 years away from the.
 <br /><br />
Oakland Raiders is a possible move of the team, they had moved from Oakland to Southern California.
 <br /><br />
And every year we will hear about lightning out of San Diego, back to the original home. Recently, it has been said that NFL will build the stadium and then rented to a team. But it looks like the magician that Raiders owner Mark - Davies (<a href="http://www.abestjerseys.com/">Wholesale Jerseys</a> ) is the key of NFL returned to Los angeles.
 <br /><br />
"Raiders can return to Losangeles is great, I would hope that this happened," said the magician. "But that depends on Mark and the Raiders and NFL. But I would want the Raiders returned to Losangeles, they belong here. We want team, we too want to teams."
